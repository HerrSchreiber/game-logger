I spent most of my time in these past 3 weeks learning Android development.
In the android-tutorial repo on my account, I figured out how to make an
Android app that can update content using APIs so I can use that same strategy
for the GameLogger app.

Also, I got all my database stuff figured out and was able to seed all of the
game data for every NES, SNES, and Genesis game into the database. All that is
missing at this point is the views for collections.
