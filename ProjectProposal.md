#Project Proposal
##a) Project title?
Game Logger - Retro Video Game Database
##b) What does it do?
Allow people to easily search for and catalogue their retro video game collections
while sharing them with friends and creating wish lists.
##c) Who is the target audience?
Nostalgic nerds who played video games growing up
##d) What sort of data will it manage?
It will contain a database of every game for a majority of the consoles between
the Atari 2600 and the Xbox (maybe branching out into newer generations later)
##e) What web technologies will it use?
Right now I'm planning on using Heroku with PostgreSQL and ~~a custom build
engine to allow it to run Yesod, a web framework based on Haskell. If it proves
to be too unwieldy, I'll probably move over to using~~ Ruby on Rails. (It turns
out that getting a Yesod project running on Heroku has been a nightmare for the
past week, I give up. Ruby it is.)
##f) Stretch goals?
I'm thinking about throwing together an Android application to run alongside
the website and/or adding functionality to add games to your collection by
taking a picture of the cartidge or CD and/or adding functionality to search
through ebay or amazon data to calculate the value of your collection.
