I was able to get my authentication system all set up on GameLogger. Now users
can register and have to be activated by email before they can do anything
(which is nothing at present).

Also, I set up SSL so that it's set up through the GameLogger.co domain name I
purchased. All that's next is to actually make the site do things!
